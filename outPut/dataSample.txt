They will be met with the fire and the fury like the world has never seen. He has been very threatening beyond a normal state, and as I said they will be met with the fire and fury and frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before. Thank you."

Truman called for Japan's surrender, warning it to "expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki
EDIT: Getting a lot of replies educating me on the role (or lack thereof) of the bombings in Japan's surrender. To clarify, I highlighted this quote not to justify Trump's threat, but to point out the eerie similarities between the two. History repeats itself, folks.

In 1957, as quoted in "No Use: Nuclear Weapons and U.S. National Security", by Thomas M. Nichols. Wikiquote -Dwight_D._Eisenhower 

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]yokoryo 620 points621 points622 points 22 days ago* (338 children)Thank you. Eisenhower, Nimitz, MacArthur, and others were on the record that the US nuclear bombing of Japan on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was unnecessary:

"The Japanese had, in fact, already sued for peace. The atomic bomb played no decisive part, from a purely military point of view, in the defeat of Japan." Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.[91]
Other U.S. military officers who disagreed with the necessity of the bombings include General of the Army Douglas MacArthur,[99][100] Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy (the Chief of Staff to the President), Brigadier General Carter Clarke (the military intelligence officer who prepared intercepted Japanese cables for U.S. officials), and Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet.
Dwight D. Eisenhower wrote in his memoir The White House Years:
In 1945 Secretary of War Stimson, visiting my headquarters in Germany, informed me that our government was preparing to drop an atomic bomb on Japan. I was one of those who felt that there were a number of cogent reasons to question the wisdom of such an act. During his recitation of the relevant facts, I had been conscious of a feeling of depression and so I voiced to him my grave misgivings, first on the basis of my belief that Japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary, and secondly because I thought that our country should avoid shocking world opinion by the use of a weapon whose employment was, I thought, no longer mandatory as a measure to save American lives.[98]
"The use of [the atomic bombs] at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender because of the effective sea blockade and the successful bombing with conventional weapons... The lethal possibilities of atomic warfare in the future are frightening. My own feeling was that in being the first to use it, we had adopted an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages. I was not taught to make war in that fashion, and wars cannot be won by destroying women and children." Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy, Chief of Staff to President Truman.[101]

The others have sound arguments, but I think MacArthur wanted the glory of actually conquering Japan on the ground.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]fullblownaydes2 112 points113 points114 points 22 days ago (0 children)100% this is the reason. MacArthur had spent months planning all the contingencies and possible strategies of an invasion. AND it was personal bc of the Philippines.

The idea that the US had a weapon that could win the war earlier and Truman held back? That was not defensible to the public at the time. 
It's sad to think that might have played a role in the order to drop a nuclear weapon. Insert Churchill quote about Democracy. 

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]Tellsyouajoke 21 points22 points23 points 22 days ago (9 children)That makes complete sense though... Currently, in our time of relative peace; we can look back and say using the nukes werent great ideas. We know how deadly and destructive they are. 
At the time, the public didn't know how destructive they were, and I highly doubt many people would have cared. They were 4 years into a real war, and the Japanese were barely considered human. Imagine being a mother who lost her two sons, and then finding out there was a way to prevent your boys' deaths. 
Do you think anyone would have cared about Japanese lives over American lives at that point?

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]BHAFA 15 points16 points17 points 22 days ago (5 children)It's a tough decision to imagine.
Like, no one knows when the war the is going to end. Over a hundred thousand Americans died in the Pacific before the bombs were dropped, so if you're in charge you need to decide whether or not to drop the bomb when there are x number of Americans getting killed everyday and you don't know how many more days, months, or years the war will continue. You're essentially estimating hundreds of thousands of lives lost when you have the technology at your disposal to end the war tomorrow. Tallying the amount of both Americans and Japanese dying everyday it could even have been conceivable that dropping the bomb might actually prevent deaths. No one knows the right course of action until long after it's happened. What If you decide not to drop it and a couple hundred thousand families are left asking you why you didn't save their sons when you the ability to do so?
I'm glad I don't have to make decisions like that. The biggest decision I made today was Ben and Jerrys or Haagen Dazs ice cream and I agonized over it.

We also knew they would be our main rival post war and wanted to make sure they knew the power we could release upon them.  

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreplyload more comments (32 replies)[–]quelar 153 points154 points155 points 22 days ago (12 children)Just to add something here, despite it not being necessary to bomb Japan to get them to surrender, there was an objective and that was to stop the war as fast as possible to stop the Russians from getting a foothold further south in Asia. They were already starting to deal with escalations in Germany over the split, they didn't want to have to deal with them in Japan as well. 

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreplyload more comments (12 replies)[–]Brother_To_Wolves 16 points17 points18 points 22 days ago (0 children)Part of the disagreement from McArthur was due to his desire to stamp his name in history as the general to lead the ground invasion of Japan. He was an incredibly prideful man and didn't like that he didn't have the same perceived respect and popularity as Ike and the other European theater generals. 

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]Vermillionbird 40 points41 points42 points 22 days ago* (14 children)My grandfather was a partner and senior engineer at Stone and Webster, which is the engineering company that built the Y-12 enrichment facility at Oak Ridge.  I asked him about the Bomb, and the thing he stressed about the project was that nobody really understood what would happen when you dropped it onto a city.
The engineers and scientists at the top of the project who saw the whole picture knew what would happen, obviously, but nobody understood on a primal level the sheer magnitude of destruction that an atomic bomb could unleash.  Before Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the atomic bomb was just data tables and projections.  There was even a theory that it'd set the atmosphere on fire and burn all the oxygen on the planet.  
The quotes you provided are instructive, because my grandfather believed that nobody making decisions understood exactly what the atomic bomb could do.   They had to see it in action to say "oh shit, that was bad, lets not do it again".  Truman didn't even know about the atomic bomb until just before Roosevelt died.
Those bombings, while horrific, arguably prevented more horrific bombings in the future (for example, if nukes had been used in Korea).  

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]Rnorman3 35 points36 points37 points 22 days ago (3 children)This is a really important piece that I think a lot of people don't realize. The Cold War was in its perpetual state of mutually assured destruction because everyone understood and was terrified of the power of the nuclear weapon that had been unleashed on the world.
I'm not entirely certain that same fear would exist without seeing the destruction first-hand. As you mentioned, even the engineers and scientists who knew about the entire project (of whom there were very few - most only knew bits and pieces that they worked on) were shocked at the result. The famous Oppenheimer quote says it better than I ever could:

We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed... A few people cried... Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture the Bhagavad Gita; Vishnu is trying to persuade the prince that he should do his duty, and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form, and says, "Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds." I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]Karranor 5 points6 points7 points 22 days ago (0 children)
There was even a theory that it'd set the atmosphere on fire and burn all the oxygen on the planet. 

Just to make clear, this theory (or hypothesis) was definitely, "no chance in hell" ruled out before the first detonation. The idea behind it was that oxygen and nitrogen have exothermic fusion and might possibly be part of a self-sustaining fusion reaction that lasts until all nitrogen and oxygen is depleted. But once someone  looked at it closer, it was pretty clear that we have nowhere near the density in the atmosphere necessary for such a fusion reaction.
In short, it was known that igniting the atmosphere was impossible before any nuclear weapon was ever detonated.

I remember reading a Reddit post about some guy that build an underground party space and it was quickly pointed out that without a second point of egress it was an extreme fire/smoke hazard.

I think remember that underground party space, the guy just buried a shipping container didn't he? That's a pretty terrible bit of engineering, those things aren't designed to withstand pressure on the roof or side panels.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]GiantQuokka 7 points8 points9 points 22 days ago (1 child)They're meant to sustain the load of being stacked with other containers. I'm not sure how they're constructed, but it could be reinforced. Possibly encased in concrete that would probably negate any pressure on it. It'd essentially be a form for the concrete that you don't remove.

My friend was stationed at a base that was taking mortar fire on the eastern side of the compound, the side with the main entrance. His unit was in a large bunker on the western side. Mattis and a few other guys come in with loads of ammo cans and start stacking it up. Mattis says something like, "any minute fellas. They kick up a fuss over there, then send the troops at this side. Classic feint. Any minute now." 5 minutes later enemy troops start attacking their bunker. My friend calls for more ammo for his 249 bravo. Mattis is already next to him with 2 cans saying, "keep it up, Marine."
That was the gist of it anyway.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]commentfreely 202 points203 points204 points 22 days ago (52 children)Strategically the use of ICBMs against NK would be ridiculous. Even using subs to fire nukes at NK would be incredibly risky. It would make far more sense to simply overwhelm them from the air and pound them to death with conventional weapons.
Responding to a clumsy NK nuke with a counterstrike would risk setting off a global conflagration.
I now blame the entire leadership of the world for letting it get this bad. NK should have been occupied as soon as their had their first nuke test.

There's a reason Russia can be in Ukraine and not be pushed out. Ukraine doesn't have nukes so Russia doesn't need to fear nuclear retaliation. They roll in the soldiers and say "this is ours now" and now you have to be the aggressor against a nuclear state to get them out of there.

I've noticed that there are a lot of articles lately discussing how NK's missiles are capable of hitting US states now. These threads usually devolve into arguments about how Japan must be getting antsy or how Seoul is (or is not) at risk of artillery shelling or chemical attacks. Not to mention, how China love-hates North Korea.
Before we get into any war scenarios, I want to make this point:
Even if we agree that North Korea has the ability to attack America, we must ask the more important question of whether they have a REASON to attack America or her allies.
If NK was more powerful than America, maybe they'd attack us. But they're not. Not by a long shot. You know that. All that rhetoric of engulfing America in a sea of flames is FOR THEIR OWN PEOPLE - who by the way are increasingly ignoring the propaganda themselves. South Koreans and North Korean defectors are waging a cultural war in North Korea by sending in USB drives full of KPOP and KDRAMAS and KFILMS. If you want internal change, that's how you do it. You have to subvert the propaganda with proof of wealth on the outside, not meet it head on by upping our own militant rhetoric. That's playing into their own game!
If we as the public and you Media folks fail to parse out the fact that NK gov't prefers the status quo, we will only bring fear and greater uncertainty to the American public because we will continue to read headlines about NK's capabilities without factoring in their reasoning.
Import side note: calling Kim Jong Un "crazy" or "unstable" doesn't do us any good because it shifts our perspective of him. We need to interpret his actions carefully, not dismiss them arrogantly. Every move he has made, from gaining weight so that he looks more like his revered grandfather to killing his China-backed brother, Kim Jong Un's actions are carefully considered to ensure his regime's preservation.
In the face of these facts we need to ask ourselves this simple question: Would he have anything to gain by attacking America or her allies with a nuclear strike?
If you've been paying attention the answer should be a resounding no. The second NK strikes first, they lose any and all moral authority as the aggressor and they leave themselves open to merciless retaliation and a sure end to the Kim dynasty.
The opposite would be true if the US were to attack. The second America strikes first, China and Russia would point an accusatory finger at us for disrupting the status quo in a region that has seen stability and growth for decades now. South Korea, should it not give consent will feel betrayed by her most important ally for going behind her back. You folks chiming in every so often saying it's "time to do something" without understanding any of this are only making the situation WORSE. You're giving journos clicks for inflammatory headlines. You're giving writers a reason to make that headline more scary and you're feeding the bias that comes from misunderstanding.
Believe me I'm no fan of the current administration but even Trump knows this. It's why he hasn't attacked. It's why he's been trying to pressure China. You don't think he'd have done something by now if he could when he's losing face over the NK issue?
China has been happily advancing its society for the last few decades and anything to hinder this progress will be stopped with great prejudice. As such a war in Korea would throw the world's economy into chaos. You're advocating a conflict between China, the US, Korea, and Japan and you don't think that's gonna be the case?
South Korea is not only a major trading partner, investor, and employer in America, it is now a regional power in Asia that should be given full consideration before any action is taken and as far as I can tell articles and comment threads don't give much attention to the South Korean perspective.
America and her Allies have aligned interests. If you go America first at the sake of an ally's wishes, you're going to lose whatever faith our other allies have in us. It's why our guarantee of retaliation is so powerful. If we didn't retaliate against a NK strike on our allies, our guarantee of security to other allies will crumble.
Sen. Lindsey Graham seems to think America wouldn't suffer in case of a war in Korea. Let me assure you if there is war American jobs will be lost (those employed by Korean companies), American lives will be lost (servicemen and civilians in Korea), and America may well lose favor among East Asian nations if the war gets out of hand and the repercussions echo throughout the region. That is to say, refugees from South Korea will flee to Japan. North Koreans will flee to China.
And you think Syria is bad?
A NK nuclear strike on America or her allies is out of the question. NK will not strike first with nuclear arms unless we corner them. You know what they say about cornering prey right? It's the dumbest thing you can do because they will go all out when there is nothing to lose. Always leave room to escape (de-escalate).
By getting suckered into the media narrative of a greater chance of war, our countries inch closer to war because of the increased fear among the public. Fear blinds us and when fear is founded on incomplete information, we make poor choices on top of being blinded.
We have missile defense systems in America and Japan. We are not without recourse there and therefore the threat is not really there. The threat is to South Korea who is a bit too close for most systems to be effective as I understand especially in an artillery barrage scenario. This is why the THAAD is so controversial. It's nice to have, but unnecessary considering the other threats it won't deter (artillery) and the political fallout it leads to (China retaliating economically against South Korea). Not to mention, South Korea already possesses America's retaliation as a deterrent to a nuclear strike as covered above.
It is true that North Korea is growing in capability and there are valid fears that even if NK never attacks, they could still sell their nuclear technology. To this I say increase monitoring and disincentivize those countries or entities who would seek to buy. I hear the Iran deal is working out alright so far.
Nuclear technology will spread throughout the world as a matter of time just as gunpowder weapons did. It will be impossible to stop the proliferation of information but what we can do is deter the USE of this information by not pushing each other into corners. What we should do instead is invest heavily in defensive technology to preemptively castrate any possible threats by proliferating wealth and trade relationships with "problem" countries.
We also need to remember though that the Korean war was a proxy war between Stalinist forces and US forces in the aftermath of World War 2. Instead of dividing up Japan like we did Germany after the war, we divided up Korea who had been suffering from Japanese exploitation for 30+ years all because Korea is located in a more strategically significant location (next to China). We must therefore understand that NK's increased nuclear capabilities are also an extension of modern Russian and US relations. The two will avoid a direct confrontation but wherever they can they will try to top each other (see Ukraine, Syria, now North Korea).
If NK starts rampaging through Asia, sure let's wipe them out. But NK has yet to invade a country since ceasefire in 1953 (save for a brief stint with the NVA, which SK was on the other side of). Skirmishes have occurred, but neither side wants it to escalate any further.
To close, I want to emphasize the importance of building the relationship between the USA and SK, USA and China, and China and SK. The stronger these relationships are (read: better informed) the even less likely NK will dare to step out of line. China won't stop feeding NK behind the scenes so if the other relationships listed get complicated, we will have lost the long term war as China gets stronger by virtue of population and NK climbs out of poverty in the long run via the feeding tube.So long as America can align its desires for the status quo (as with China) by building up relationships with Countries around NK, we will continue to prevent war as we have the last 70 years.
Mr. President, please feel free to ignore the NK threat as there is none in the face of America's overwhelming advantage in every respect. America, don't entertain the idea of striking preemptively and you won't give China and Russia any political ammo to shoot at us. If NK goes postal on SK then yeah let loose the hounds of war but till then rest easy as we have countermeasures in place already.
TLDR: If America wants peace it has one option. Better journalism. Stop talking about what NK is capable of and start talking about what NK wants: the status quo. Also include what WE are capable of in defensive terms. Should the bald eagle bat its eyes when the bunny bares its teeth?

In the original civ they had a ten scale on aggression, and Gandhi was a 1, but when you get democracy that lowers the aggression by two, which due to a computer error gives Gandhi an aggression rating of 255.

Tourism victories entirely rely on you play a tourism based civ, getting very specific wonders, and not just getting conquered, while also having no one notice your influence. With all the resources you put into culture you could just as easily go full science and economics and win science or domination. Domination is arguably the easiest way to win, especially in 6, as it only requires you to hold your original capital. You can egg other people to fight amongst each other as you take a scientific lead and then simply clean up the weakened players.

Converting the population to sympathize with you destroys the Country internally and eliminates a threat with minimum costs... Albeit, it takes a lot longer.
Conventional Warfare should always be a last minute pursuit. If North Korea really launches a missile at us, then, yeah, going to war may be the best bet.
But if it's just threats and launches in international waters... Well, we just have to play the waiting game. Eventually Kim Jong-un will die, and either his Sister or his Son will inherit his position. His Sister is much more reasonable(She was in charge temporarily awhile back, and during that time North and South Korea made insane diplomatic progress) and his son is... a wild card. We have no idea if he'll grow up to be just another Dictator, or if he'll be able to see passed his position.
Not to mention that their population is slowly starting to realize that their Country isn't all that great. Military service may be mandatory... But unless a soldier has morale, his contribution is fairly meaningless. Plus, you never know when the citizens might finally fully realize their situation and stage a revolt. Then, I bet the South Koreans would be more than happy to help out.

Only one city in Vietnam really has any significant amount of McDonalds. The capital has none, actually. Rock n Roll isn't very popular, and porn is still illegal. Vietnamese culture is still dominant. So whoever you're quoting is just wrong.

In the face of these facts we need to ask ourselves this simple question: Would he have anything to gain by attacking America or her allies with a nuclear strike?
If you've been paying attention the answer should be a resounding no. The second NK strikes first, they lose any and all moral authority as the aggressor and they leave themselves open to merciless retaliation and a sure end to the Kim dynasty.

This is why I'm not really worried about them. If he strikes against the US, he is 100% getting wiped off the face of the earth. How does that benefit him? 

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]bolbbalgano3o 304 points305 points306 points 22 days ago (78 children)I'm mostly worried if internal NK politics at some point corner him, with foreign backing, what if he decides to press the button since his life would be over at it is anyway?

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]Acheron13 273 points274 points275 points 22 days ago (45 children)I'm more worried about the spread of this technology.  N. Korea has shown they don't give a crap about laws or sanctions and will do anything to make money.  Every one of these tests is a show for potential buyers.
As soon as they show off the ability to launch a nuclear armed ICBM, Iran will have it right after their payment to Kim clears.  In response Saudi Arabia will have them shortly after and possibly Egypt.
If N. Korea has a credible capability to nuke US cities, that may put doubt in the minds of US allies under the US nuclear umbrella that the US will actually protect them in the event of conflict.  Now you could have S. Korea or Japan thinking they need their own nuclear weapons to assure their safety, both of whom could easily develop them.  Who knows how China will react to Japan developing nuclear weapons, but China will have brought it on themselves by letting N. Korea get to this point.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreplyload more comments (2 replies)[–]Namika 37 points38 points39 points 22 days ago* (4 children)The problem with him having nukes is not that it means he will use them, it's that he can hide behind threats of using them and get away with atrocities.
Obviously, Kim knows that if he nuked the US he would be killed in the counterattack. That is predictable. Likewise, once Kim has a small arsenal of working nuclear ICBMs, he can state that any US invasion will lead to him nuking US cities in retaliation. Very predictable.
...but what happens if North Korea gets an arsenal of nukes, and then goes around lighting all sorts of troublesome issues? What if they openly state that they are selling nukes of Iran, Yemen, Hezbolla, or anyone else willing to buy one? What if they start shooting South Korean passenger airliners out of the sky? Or use their 50+ submarines and attack a US carrier? Then what?
Normally, we know North Korea refrains from those sorts of obvious transgressions because they know it could lead to a counterstrike invasion and the end of Kim's life. The fear of the US retaliating kept the rogue state somewhat in check. But now that he has nukes and can state he will nuke the US if they invade... that's not really an option is it? The US won't invade them if doing so will lead to Kim launching his nukes. So what incentive at all does Kim's regime have on playing nice? What happens if he starts killing civilians or starts firing artillery shells with Sarin gas at Seoul? You can't retaliate anymore if any threat on Kim's regime will lead to his nukes being launched.
TL;DR: It's incredibly dangerous to let North Korea have nukes because they have already shown their disdain for international pressure and have a history of making violent threats. Up to now those threats have been kept in check, but once they have a credible nuclear deterrent Kim can do more and more intolerable things and break more treaties since he knows no one will invade a nuclear North Korea.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]bhu87ygv 11 points12 points13 points 22 days ago (1 child)This. Nuclear weapons changes the calculus. Though, I would argue that N. Korea already has a trump card in that Seoul's proximity to the DMZ makes it an easy target without nuclear weapons. It's so close that the North Koreans can shell the city with artillery and from what I've read, tens of thousands would die from the initial attacks.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreplyload more comments (13 replies)[–]uhuhshesaid 19 points20 points21 points 22 days ago (0 children)I think you make a lot of really valid, well thought out points. But I'm worried about the cornering strategy here. 
I don't think Trump wants war - he wants a distraction. But cornering a sovereign foreign power with US demands is the surest way to cut off your nose to spite your face.
In Uganda, for a long time, the Kill-the-Gays bill (also known as the Anti-Homosexuality Act) was looked down on by President Museveni. He spoke out against it more than once, and worked to delay it in Parliament. 
Then it hit the US press. And everyone cried out (understandably so) and told the USA to pressure Uganda not to sign the bill. And so the US put incredible pressure on the Ugandan government. But it was coming up to an election year. So the news and opinion articles in Uganda didn't focus on LGBT rights, but on African rights. The argument was "How long is Africa going to let the West tell it what to do?" and also, "The USA needs Uganda as a strategic base, fuck em, what are they gonna do?". Hell most Ugandans only liked the provision on the AHA that gave life sentences to child molesters. But most were for it in the end simply to prove a point. 
At the end of the day Museveni could sign the AHA into law and look like a strong African leader or not sign and look like an American puppet. 
So he signed it. Aid was cut and rich leaders shrugged it off.  
I worry that Trump doesn't know his limits on Kim Jongun. While there isn't a real 'win' for NK attacking the USA we do not want Trump pushing him to a point where he will look weak if he doesn't act. Trump doesn't measure his tone or his words carefully and is itching for a distraction. And I do worry that this war of rhetoric could lead to NK being cornered into action. 
I don't really think they'll strike the USA, but there is a litany of mid level aggression they can pull that will leave tensions amped up and could provoke Trump into declaring war. 
You seem confident that Trump won't overstep this. I do hope you are right. I don't think he knows where that line is and is so applauded for dancing over lines - and gets so high off that applause - that he'd be willing to jeopardize our security in order to get it.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreplyload more comments (13 replies)[–]pointofyou 7 points8 points9 points 22 days ago (2 children)Your post reads well but as others have pointed it's mostly an opinion piece. I understand your point but feel you fail to acknowledge that we're in a situation where common sense and rational thinking in terms of game theory doesn't apply.
Both Trump and Un are volatile and impulsive. What's more, I don't think the biggest issue about NK attaining a nuke is that they'll attack. It's that once they have one they can't be invaded anymore if need be. I remember a comment here on reddit some years ago detailing how that is the actual issue with nuclear weapons.
You're overestimating the rationality of both leaders IMO. Un is crazy and deluded enough to justify going down in flames if he believes he can take significant portions of his enemies with him. 
Trump is impulsive enough to use this situation to distract the world from his other shit and dumb enough to believe the US could take action without causing any damage to itself or its allies. 

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreplyload more comments (2 replies)[–]SgtSmackdaddy 8 points9 points10 points 22 days ago (0 children)North Korea wants to reunify the Korean Peninsula. If they have deterrence vs the US and an external power wants to give "The West" a black eye, they could arm N Korea and set them loose. It also sends a message to all tin pot dictators out there that if you violate international law and make a ICBM, "the West" won't do shit except throw words at you.  
Not that I have a solution for Donald Trump in the present day. They should have been dealt with decades ago before they got the bomb. We knew about the human rights abuse but ignored it because it wasn't a threat to us and we didn't want to deal with the refugees. Now this tumor has metastasized and we're left with no even reasonable options. You can also thank China and to a lesser extent Russia for the mess we're in.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]Redirectx2 5 points6 points7 points 22 days ago* (3 children)First, I would like to say: “Well written!” However, though your thoughts are well rounded & clearly expressed, ultimately, they are uninformed and one-sided. (Most likely due to your up-bringing and education)
I have lived most of my life in one of those “EA American allied countries,” and I find it very interesting that Americans (occasionally Europeans.) think that they are the perpetrators of all good and evil in the world. When something bad happens they blame Trump or Obama. When something good happens they accept congratulations on a job well done and “humbly” accept the “thanks” of the world with dignity. 
Let me just put forth a different theory on the current situation between NK, SK, Japan, China etc.

American Foreign Policy

Composed of the following points:
• Preserving the national security of the United States
• Promoting world peace and a secure global environment
• Maintaining a balance of power among nations
• Working with allies to solve international problems
• Promoting democratic values and human rights
• Furthering cooperative foreign trade and global involvement in international trade organizations
Examining these goals closely reveals that they are based on cooperation with other nations, although "preserving the national security of the United States" implies possible competition and conflict.
Americas “big stick” mindset, in the above interactions, was widely accepted due to the dangerously close contest that was WW2. In a way it was a measure to prevent the world from ever getting into a situation where America would be under such a threat again.
If you notice No.1 on that list is national security and the last one is furthering cooperative foreign trade. Keep this in mind as we go to No.2

National Responsibility 

An essential part of a dictatorship is…..it must have enemies. It must have an outside threat to achieve national unity. To demand much and give little is much to ask of any society unless, there is an overwhelming need for cohesive unity to preserve the health and lives of you and yours.
The enemy is, of course, the most convenient. If not America it would be S.K., Japan, China… anybody convenient. The fact that it is currently America has nothing to do with America itself or its actions per se, in its present state. In fact, SK is the original and most logical enemy, yet America presents a more foreign and overpowering alternative. 
An enemy would be found, and an arms race would ensue nuclear or otherwise. The responsibility of escalation hostilities are inevitably those of the dictatorship as its perceived threat can only be maintained with more and more escalation and extremism in rhetoric and action. This is a fact, regardless of active or passive participation by the “threat.”
The dictator nation must take responsibility for its needs and requirements.

The inevitable step on the path of no return.

Dictatorships all end the same….due mainly to the escalations in conflict they must make in order to maintain control. As the conditions get harder the threat must grow in proportion and in relation the reaction.
In Summery
The current conflict is not caused by American action or inaction but as the inevitable process of dictatorship toward its end.
American foreign policy in its current state with national safety as its No.1 concern cannot ignore NK therefore a showdown be it nuclear or conventional is inevitable. 
Alternative actions such as pressure economic or military by China or Russia may be temporary stop gaps but the end is the same. I know it, you know it. Changing journalism? What? Such worthless platitudes are one-sided because you will only be changing one side’s point of view; the side that doesn’t matter.
Basing your ideas and theories on real world problems on a foundation of wishful thinking is and ideas of passive triumph is always nice and sounds good, but it is not realistic nor based on humanities tendencies.

Preventing nuclear technology from spreading is far more important.  There's no coming back once a radical group has access to it.

President Donald Trump said North Korea will be "Met with fire and fury and, frankly, power the likes of which the world has never seen before" if Kim Jong Un's regime continues to threaten the U.S. "He has been very threatening," Trump told reporters in Bedminster, New Jersey on Tuesday.
The two developments - test flights of an ICBM and progress on the warhead - add to the pressure on Trump to respond to accelerating North Korea provocations.
Tillerson was in Thailand Tuesday and heads to Malaysia before returning to the U.S. "And we hope, again, that this ultimately will result in North Korea coming to the conclusion to choose a different pathway, and when the conditions are right that we can sit and have a dialogue around the future of North Korea so that they feel secure and prosper economically," Tillerson told reporters in Manila on Aug. 7.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]Youwokethewrongdog 12 points13 points14 points 22 days ago (0 children)They used to be eight zeros, for like, decades, because one general didn't want anything delaying launch of said missiles, including ducking around trying to find and enter the codes.
The codes used to be written next to the launch apparatus as well.

And how he gave them 4 billion dollars and said “This agreement is good for the United States, good for our allies, and good for the safety of the entire world. It’s a crucial step toward drawing North Korea into the global community.”

The possible events of a major military conflict is unfolding before our eyes and people want to make cheap jabs at President Trump and make Fallout 5 jokes.  North Korea has slowly evolved itself into a country capable of launching ICBMs with Nuclear warheads.  This really is no laughing matter.

I'm more concerned about the inevitable armchair generals who reliably conjure up some wall of text telling us why this isn't a big deal.

And too many people don't see the difference between this and Russia or the old Soviet Union. This is a single man with absolute and unquestioned authority, not a room full of rich guys with a lot to loose. If he felt like he was going down, he could very well fire everything he has, and there's no reason to believe anyone would stop him.
I agree with Trump on almost nothing, but I agree that King Jong Un cannot have a nuclear weapon that can reach the United States, and we need to do whatever is necessary to stop it.

An idiot narcissist and a militaristic cult leader are having a dick-waving competition over nuclear weapons. Rational discussion is hard to imagine and anybody curling up to weep isn't gonna post.

I'm not very knowledgeable on this, but I'm wondering about the threat of an EMP strike? It seems like everyone is worried about the possibility of a nuclear strike hitting on/near land, but could an EMP be a legit and serious threat? Would it be enough for NK to launch a nuclear warhead into the atmosphere and detonate it over SK, Japan, or the US that could potentially disrupt telecomms, etc.? As I said, I'm not super knowledgeable about this, but I just recently read One Second After and it freaked the shit out of me. 

permalinkembedsavereportgive goldreply[–]Teknoman117 18 points19 points20 points 22 days ago (11 children)TBH, we really don't know (no real public information).  There's been a lot of theoretical work, but there are only 3 known large scale nuclear EMP tests (starfish prime (us), fishbowl (us), and test 184 (ussr)), none of them over highly populated areas and all before the modern integrated circuit was developed.  So the short answer, we don't really know for certain what might happen.

I wish everyone, not just Americans, could see the Peace Memorial Museum in Hiroshima. Because then everyone would truly understand why words like these are absolutely terrifying...
We should do everything possible to avoid confrontations like this, not egging on in a dick waving battle.

Does that count as escalation? How about telling the US they will be punished 1000-fold with nuclear fire? Does that count?

permalinkembedsavereportgive goldreply[–]orek74 105 points106 points107 points 22 days ago (17 children)North Korea's propaganda phrasings really have not changed in years. In 2001:
"March 15, 2001: Pyongyang threatens to “take thousand-fold revenge” on the United States “and its black-hearted intention to torpedo the dialogue between north and south [Korea].” "
